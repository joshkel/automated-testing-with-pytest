# Automated Testing with Python

Or, Making Pytest Your Batman

These are the slides from a presentation I gave at [KnoxPy](http://knoxpy.org/) in November 2017.

You can also watch [a recording of the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzY_YZCIVg4).

Presentation created with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup).

## To Do

* I'd like a better example for arrange - act - assert.
* Give an example of pytest showing details of failing test arguments.
* Show a sample code coverage report.
