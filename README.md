# Automated Testing with Python

Or, Making Pytest Your Batman

These are the slides from a presentation I gave at [KnoxPy](http://knoxpy.org/) in November 2017 and at [PyTennessee](https://pytennessee.org) in February 2019.

To view the slides, download, run `yarn`, then run `yarn start`.  Or you can [view a PDF version](automated-testing-with-pytest.pdf).

You can also watch [a recording of the presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzY_YZCIVg4).
